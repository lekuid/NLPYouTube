this has to end if you want to play in Africa it's not about pushing the cheapest product lines into the continents bad
is about developing products specifically made for African consumers that fit our desire for quality and our diverse
West Africans don't value brands just as you shouldn't pushpit cheapest for climbs into the African market
don't think that your father to take off that any work African consumers as highly brand conscious and the loyal to brands
around the longest because I am so you know what a message next those brands associated with quality bands
love bit more new ones for relationship with brands because you see we inherited and preferences from our family and friends

you are awesome need to spend the money to ensure that our brand is present in all of the places that we African stop and talking

I am not asked me to customer check for the first month's rent and deposit and I was like sorry what because I honestly could not
but then when was the last time someone back home ask me to customer check but like I said Africa as digital transformation is
how much more exciting visiting e commerce past taking off and the new Africa trade agreement who make it easier for cross product
which means African made products bought by African consumers at crossing African borders easier and

my last month which really pains which have to talk about in 2021 Africa is one country I know that of
great length about some of the common consumption habits across the different African markets but it's important to remember that
Africa is not one country and African communities even with in individual countries and not a more genius we speak
over 2100 languages therefore the customer positioning and market segments for different products can
substantially and if you want to get into Africa you need to get into the we take tea and coffee consumption
example moroccans prefer to purchase the ati in traditional market Indians prefer to purchase that you and coffee in super
political preferred to purchase their products in local local culture also has a big influence
what we buy and where we buy take me and my group of girlfriend for example when you look at this thing propose girlfriend on
with the same young black males females that grew up in one of South Africa's major Thumbs up him to Johannesburg to the suture educate
unemployment some segmentation studied referred was as Black Diamond members of South Africa's fast growing affluent
instruments of black community but if you really do your homework you will first appreciate that this group of thanks all friends is made up of
58 of South Africa's 10 tribes and even though our tastes are heavily in trench into the urban culture of Johannesburg
respective traditional culture that influences what we consume and how we consume it and it's easy to see if you just open
respective pantry so if you want to product to thrive in the diverse African markets you need to do your homework
need to take your traditional segmentation plans one or two levels deeper yes it more work but my continent
is one that I want to leave you with this essay of my wallet is here for the taking but not for long African businesses
Appu me and trade across of 55 countries is getting easier and faster by the day so it won't be long

Anarkali ka Bali I am a linguist training and a Technologies by profession I have worked in academia insta
in small companies and multinational for over two decades doing research in and building language Technology systems my dream is to see
zoology work across the language barrier as a researcher in Microsoft research labs India I work in the field of Atal language technology and
speech technology and I worry about how can we make Technology accessible to people across the board in respective of the language that is
natural language processing in artificial intelligence speech Technology it is a big was a buzzword right now everybody is talking about what
exactly is NLP or natural language processing simple term this is the part of Computer Science Engineering that makes machines
process understand and generate natural language which is the language that humans speak when you are interacting with a boy
time to book your train tickets or flight tickets when you are a speaking to a voice based digital assistant in your phone is natural language processing
sing that underpins the entire technology that makes that work this work how does it work in a very well
basic way it's about data show a huge amount of data of how actually humans use language
then process by certain algorithms and techniques that make the Machines learn the patterns of natural language of
this is another buzzword that you hear a lot about is Deep neural networks and these are the advanced techniques that under
lot of there in AP start the right now and I will not going to the details of how that works with thing that you really have to understand and keep in mind
is it all of this requires a humongous amount of data natural language data if you want speech system
are to Converse with you in Gujarati the first thing you require is a lot of Beta of Gujarati people speaking to each other in their own language
2017 Microsoft came up with a speech recognition system which was able to transcribe speech into text
better than human that and this system was trained on 200 million transcribed words in 2018
English Chinese machine translation system was able to translate from English to Chinese as well as any human bilingual could and this was trained on
3 million bilingual sentence very very exciting time in natural language processing and Technology
BSc science fiction which we read about and watched kind of come true in front of our own eyes making giant beats
Technical Advancement but join tweets are limited to very few languages Chaudhari
a very good friend of mine and he has studied this in some detail and he has book that resource distribution across languages in the world
says that this follow what is called a power distribution which essentially means other four languages Arabic Chinese English and Spanish which have
maximum amount of resources available on other handful of languages which can also benefit from another resources and the
knowledge that available right now but 90% of the world's languages which have no resources are very little resources
this revolution that we're talking about his essentially bypass 5000 languages of the world what this means is the resources slang
aap Technologies bill for them soap researchers and Technologist get attracted towards them webel more Technologies for them they create more resource for them with the like a rich getting richer
end of a cycle and resource for languages safe for this new technology for them nobody was for them and the divide digital divide between languages
is ever expanding and by implication is also the divide between the communities that speak this languages is pending
so in Microsoft in project alora we aim to Bridge this gap time to see how can we cry
more data by innovative method have more techniques to build Technology without having a lot of resources and what are the applications that
truly benefit these communities so at the moment that this might seem very theoretically Kota talk about data and techniques in let me
give you a very concrete example here I will linguist at heart I love languages that's what I love talking about so let me tell you about Allah
which is the meaning of you might not know about gondi gondi is a South Central driven language it is spoken by 3 million people in 5 days of
to put the some some kind of perspective Norwegian is spoken by 5 million people and well by a little under a million
gondi is actually a pretty robust and pretty large community of the Gond tribals in India but by
best course Atlas of languages in danger gondi is designated valuable status
an NGO that provides a citizen journalism portal for the gold community by making local stories accessible through mobile phones
absolutely no text support for gondi there is no data available for gondi no resources available for gondi all content that is created mod
unedited is done manually and what we did was that we brought together all the stakeholders in NGO like the unit and
institution that applied in the Raipur a not-for-profit children's book publisher like Kasam books and most importantly the speakers of the community become the
tribals themselves participated in this activity and for the first time edited and translated children's book in Hindi weaver
to put out 200 Box with very first time in Hindi so that the children had access to stories and books in their own language
extension of this was Aadivasi radio which was like an app that we built and developed in Microsoft Research and then out there along with the arts
oldest takes a Hindi text to speech system and allows the to read out news and articles provided by CG NET sorry
in gondi language users can now use this app to read watch news and access any information to text and voice
their own language a very interesting thing is that this app is now being used to translate by the community to translate text from Hindi to
are gondi now what that will result in a lot of parallel data that we call parallel data that allow us to build machine translation system for gondi which
actually open up a window for the gone community to the world and what is even more important is now we know how to do this we have entire
we can replicate this for any language and any language community which is in a similar situation as the gone tribals
education gas information access yes but what about earning a living what about how can we make it
make these people on living through the triple tools that all of us it take for granted this is Vivek Chaudhari who is another researcher at MSR and elaborate the Manu
designed a platform called Karya for providing digital micro tasks to the underserved communities his aim was basically to
find a way to provide a means of dignified labour to the populations of rural populations in the urban populations of this country they don't have AC
all the knowledge to use the digital program platforms that all of us are you everyday without even thinking but
what is the large literate population that wants to work right and how can we make this possible
is one such way through which this population can get on to the digital world and you know to that
find work and do tasks that can be done on the money so we saw this and this is wonderful we could probably use this for data collection as well so
aamli which is a small village of 200 people in the Wardha district of Maharashtra and decided to use Karya to collect Marathi data
thinking I should a lot of Marathi speakers also in the audience that Marathi is not a low-resource language but it is definitely a mainstream language of the country
Assamese language technology is concerned but it is a low resource language we went to this village and we had a very successful data
chicken you know this village is very remote they have no TV have no electricity they have no mobile
single flying by Helen Wave Your phone around if you want to use your mobile to call anyone all this data but more than that
very valuable lessons in life one is the pride in one's own language the people of Amla was thrilled to be doing this because
advancing their own language by doing this the second was the value of community very quickly this became a village community
people gather together in task and do this together as a group and the third is the importance of story telling people of
stop the content that in the morning during the daytime they would do recordings of stories in Karya and and and
weather in thara village and retail in recount we stories to village scientist we get so caught up
Science and Technology part of what we are doing in our work which is the next best model to have how can we I increase the accuracy of my system how can I
build next best system there is that we forget the reason why we are doing this the people and any successful technology is the one that keep
the people and the user's upfront and Central and when is not doing that we also realise the technologies from the very small part of this
and other things in the story maybe that are social cultural and policy interventions that are required as Masters Technology
worked on a project call video kheti that allowed Hindi speaking farmers in Central India to search for agricultural videos
by speaking into a phone based App we went to Madhya Pradesh to collect data for this abhi came back and your training a model with covered with
bad results not working two way confused why is this happening to be looked deeper and deeper into the data and discovered that yes we had collected data from
thought was a very style and quite a village in the evening but what we hadn't heard while we were doing this was that there was constant bus off
distance x from the recording of the insect which was actually distorting a speech second thing was the
when there too kind of test app in the village I click in rani meri is a very well regarded design in research
we found the women couldn't pronounce the Sanskrit R is worth that we had for some of the search terms so like a
rasayanik padarth se kharpatwar niyantran which is like the term for chemical pesticides because we got these
terms from the agricultural extension centre and the women in their farming do not interact with that centre at all the men do
women public you something but simpler like the wiser kadamana which basically means killing space with medicine
what I have learnt to my journey and what I would like to put a cross to you by now I hope you and send me is that there are a majority of the
languages that require intensive investment for resource creation if they are to benefit from language technology and unlikely to happen
very fast and efficient manner it is extremely important for us to ensure that the community derives maximum benefit
from whatever that we're doing in the language text area and to do this and deliver a positive social impact on these communities we
what we call the modified 4D design thinking methodology for the fore the means Discover design develop and deploy
the problem that language Technology can solve for a particular language community this observation that approach can help allocate resources with the most needed
fine for the users and the language understand the diversity in the living with linguistic properties and languages of the world and don't think always like this
how can we just adapted for Marathi or for gondi rapidly and applied frequently is an iterative process that will help you
fast and early failures will eventually lead to success important thing is to Persevere do not give up and here I am
remember the story of this to aboriginal Australian women Patricia O'Connor and Isabella is all the best
97 to the University of Queensland and they wanted to learn their own language Kalyug Bombay and they were told it bluntly your languages that it's been that for three decades
you cannot work on this find something else to work on they did not give up they went to the community with oral memories oral 2
oral literature and founded the Bombay Museum which became the most important cultural and linguistics
for the language and its community they did not have technology they will power now with the power of Technology we can in
sure that the next page is written in Samai from Finland live what from Canada or mundari from India thank you
